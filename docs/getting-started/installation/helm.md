# Helm

[Helm], which is de facto standard package manager for Kubernetes, allows installing applications from parameterized
YAML manifests called Helm [charts].

To address shortcomings of [static YAML manifests](./kubectl.md) we provide the Helm chart to deploy the Vul-Operator.
The Helm chart supports all [Install Modes](./configuration.md#install-modes).

As an example, let's install the operator in the `vul-system` namespace and configure it to select all namespaces,
except `kube-system` and `vul-system`:

1. Clone the chart directory:
   ```
   git clone --depth 1 --branch {{ git.tag }} https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/vul-operator.git
   cd vul-operator
   ```
   Or add Khulnasoft chart repository:
   ```
   helm repo add khulnasoft https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/helm-charts/
   helm repo update
   ```
2. Install the chart from a local directory:
   ```
   helm install vul-operator ./deploy/helm \
     --namespace vul-system \
     --create-namespace \
   ```
   Or install the chart from the Khulnasoft chart repository:
   ```
   helm install vul-operator khulnasoft/vul-operator \
     --namespace vul-system \
     --create-namespace \
     --version {{ var.chart_version }}
   ```

   Configuration options can be passed using the `--set` parameter. To list only the fixed vulnerabilities in the cluster, one can use the following command.
   ```
      helm install vul-operator ./deploy/helm \
     --namespace vul-system \
     --create-namespace \
     --set="vul.ignoreUnfixed=true"
   ```
   
   There are many [values] in the chart that can be set to configure Vul-Operator. See the [Customising][customising] section for more details.
4. Check that the `vul-operator` Helm release is created in the `vul-system` namespace, and it has status
   `deployed`:
   ```console
   $ helm list -n vul-system
   NAME              	NAMESPACE         	REVISION	UPDATED                             	STATUS  	CHART                   	APP VERSION
   vul-operator	vul-system	1       	2021-01-27 20:09:53.158961 +0100 CET	deployed	vul-operator-{{ var.chart_version }}	{{ git.tag[1:] }}
   ```
   To confirm that the operator is running, check that the `vul-operator` Deployment in the `vul-system`
   namespace is available and all its containers are ready:
   ```console
   $ kubectl get deployment -n vul-system
   NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   vul-operator   1/1     1            1           11m
   ```
   If for some reason it's not ready yet, check the logs of the Deployment for errors:
   ```
   kubectl logs deployment/vul-operator -n vul-system
   ```

## Install as Helm dependency

There are cases, when potential chart developers want to add the operator as dependency. An example would be the creation of an umbrella chart for an application, which depends on 3d-party charts.

In this case, It maybe not suitable to install the Vul Operator in the same namespace as the main application. Instead, we can use the Helm value `operator.namespace` to define a namespace where only the operator will be installed. The Operator chart will then either create a new namespace if not existing or use the existing one.

## Uninstall

You can uninstall the operator with the following command:

```
helm uninstall vul-operator -n vul-system
```

You have to manually delete custom resource definitions created by the `helm install` command:

!!! danger
    Deleting custom resource definitions will also delete all security reports generated by the operator.

    ```
    kubectl delete crd vulnerabilityreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd exposedsecretreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd configauditreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clusterconfigauditreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd rbacassessmentreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd infraassessmentreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clusterrbacassessmentreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clustercompliancereports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clusterinfraassessmentreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd clusterconfigauditreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    kubectl delete crd sbomreports.khulnasoft-lab.github.io
    ```

## Customising the Helm Chart

The Vul Operator Helm Chart can be customised in the same way as other Helm Charts, by overwriting values in the `values.yaml` files.

You can find all the values that can be customised in the README of [the Helm Chart on GitHub.][helm-dir]

There are two ways to overwrite values in a Helm chart upon installation:

**Create a custom values.yaml file with your changes and give Helm the file upon installation**

   e.g. to specfy that Vul should ignore all unfixed vulnerabilities:
   ```yaml
   vul:
      ignoreUnfixed: true
   ```

   The file can be passed into Vul with the `--values` flag in Helm:

   ```yaml
   helm install vul-operator khulnasoft/vul-operator \
      --namespace vul-system \
      --create-namespace \
      --values values.yaml
   ```

**Set the values that you want to customise in the installation command**

   This is done with the `--set` command in Helm:

   ```yaml
   helm install vul-operator khulnasoft/vul-operator \
      --namespace vul-system \
      --create-namespace \
      --set="vul.ignoreUnfixed=true" \
   ```
